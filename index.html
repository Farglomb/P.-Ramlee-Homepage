        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Tan Sri Datuk Amar Teuku Zakaria bin Teuku Nyak Puteh (later Ramlee bin Puteh) (22 March 1929 – 29 May 1973), better known by his stage name P. Ramlee (Puteh Ramlee), was a Malaysian actor, filmmaker, musician, and composer famous in modern-day Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Southern Thailand. Born in Penang, Malaya, he is regarded as a prominent icon of Malay language entertainment. His contributions to the film and music industry began when he made his acting debut in Singapore for Malay Film Productions in 1948. He reached the height of his career there throughout the 1950s before declining in the 1960s when he moved to Kuala Lumpur to work for Merdeka Film Productions. Although acclaimed for his career in Singapore, P. Ramlee was denounced in Malaysia during his life, with his career only facing retrospective resurgence there decades after his death.</p>
